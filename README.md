# Electric Vehicle Data Platform

## What's This All About?

Welcome to the Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Platform! Our system is designed to manage large amounts of EV data across multiple databases. This helps us handle data efficiently and make it easy for everyone to understand EV trends and statistics.

## Key Features

### MongoDB for Distributed Data Management

- **Why MongoDB?** It is scalable, powerful, and good at handling large amounts of data, making it our chosen database for storing and organizing EV data.
- **Smart Data Storage**: Unique identifiers are assigned to each record via a hash function, optimizing data retrieval and storage efficiency.
- **Data Partitioning**: We distribute data to two databases based on hash values(cut-off year), ensuring efficient data handling.

### Real-Time Data Processing with Spark DataFrame

- **Fast Data Processing**: Using Spark DataFrame, we transform and analyze data in real-time, quickly extracting valuable features.
- **Efficient Computations**: Thanks to Spark's distributed nature, we process vast datasets efficiently, ensuring timely analytics.

### Interactive Web Application

- **Dual Interfaces**: Tailored experiences for both casual users and database managers.
- **Lookup Page**: Explore and interact with EV data through advanced search and aggregation tools.
- **Visualization Page**: Engage with data through interactive visualizations that make trends easy to understand.
- **Database Managerâ€™s Interface**: Direct database interactions via a Python-powered backend for precise control over data operations. Database managers can add, remove, or change records easily. These changes are smartly sent to the correct database.

## Wrapping Up

Our Electric Vehicle Data Platform is powerful and designed to handle lots of data with ease. We use a combination of MongoDB, PySpark, Flask, and JavaScript to make sure our platform works well and meets the needs of both database managers and regular users.
